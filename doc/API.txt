To use this package as a librarie, you need the provided python's
modules described below.


mydifflib.py
------------
provides functions for Longest Common Subsequence calculation.

lcs2(X, Y, equal):
	apply the greedy lcs/ses algorithm between X and Y sequence
        (should be any Python's sequence)
	equal is a function to compare X and Y which must return 0 (or
	a Python false value) if X and Y are different, 1 (or Python
	true value) if they are identical
	return a list of matched pairs in tuples

lcsl(X, Y, equal):
	same as above but return the length of the lcs

quick_ratio(a,b):
	optimized version of the standard difflib.py quick_ratio
	(without junk and class) 
	return an upper bound on ratio() relatively quickly.
 

input.py
--------
provides functions for converting DOM tree or xml file in order to
process it with xmldiff functions.

tree_from_stream(stream, norm_sp=1, ext_ges=0, ext_pes=0, include_comment=1, encoding='UTF-8'):
	create and return  internal tree from xml stream (open file or
        IOString)   
	if norm_sp = 1, normalize space and new line
	if ext_ges = 1, include all external general (text) entities. 
	if ext_pes = 1, include all external parameter entities, including the external DTD subset.
        if include_comment = 1, include comment nodes
	encoding specify the encoding to use

tree_from_dom(root):
	create and return internal tree from DOM subtree


fmes.py
-------
Fast match/ Edit script algorithm (not sure to obtain the minimum edit
cost, but accept big documents).

Warning, the process(oldtree, newtree) function has a side effect:
after call it, oldtree == newtree.

class FmesCorrector(self, formatter, f=0.6, t=0.5):
        class which contains the fmes algorithm  
	formatter is a class instance which handle the edit script
        formatting (see format.py)
	f and t are algorithm parameter, 0 < f < 1 and 0.5 < t < 1
	in xmldiff, f = 0.59 and t = 0.5
 
FmesCorrector.process_trees(self, tree1, tree2):
        launch diff between internal tree tree1 (old xmltree) and
        tree2 (new xml tree) 
	return an actions list


format.py
---------
provides classes for converting xmldiff algorithms output to DOM
tree or printing it in native format or xml xupdate format. The
formatter interface is the following :

class AbstractFormatter:
        abstract class designed to be overrinden by concrete
        formatters

AbstractFormatter.init(self):
        method called before the begining of the tree 2 tree
	correction 

AbstractFormatter.add_action(self, action):
        method called when an action is added to the edit script

AbstractFormatter.format_action(self, action):
        method called by end() to format each action in the edit
	script 
        at least this method should be overriden

AbstractFormatter.end(self):
        method called at the end of the tree 2 tree correction


the concrete classes are InternalPrinter, XUpdatePrinter and 
DOMXUpdateFormatter


See xmldiff.py for an use example.
