CHANGES
=======
2.0.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Get rid of the C-extensions in preparation of major refactoring to make the
  code maintainable.

- Refactored from using hierarcical infinitely recursing lists of lists to an
  object hierarchy.

- Renamed the difflib module to helpers so it doesn't shadow stdlib.


1.1.2 (unreleased)
------------------

- When I fixed the xpath namespace handling I also changed the tag names to
  an xpath syntax. This was unhelpful, so I changed that back. To solve this
  I have had to extend the return format from the parser and ass a N_NSPREFIX
  that contains the prefix. This is used by the differ to return correct
  xpaths without changing the tags.

- The AbstractFormatter.init() method made exactly zero sense and made it
  practically impossible to set the output stream to anything but sys.stdout.
  Fixed and deprecated.


1.1.1 (2018-06-20)
------------------

- When moving attributes the secondary rename action xpath was
  '//LogilabXmldiffTmpAttr<attrib>' which is a tag specification.
  Changed this to '//@LogilabXmldiffTmpAttr<attrib>', so an attribute
  is specified.


1.1.0 (2018-06-15)
------------------

- When using namespaces, the returned xpaths are now in the form ns_prefix:tag
  instead of the earlier {ns_uri}tag, which isn't correct xpaths.
